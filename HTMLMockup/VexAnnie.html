			<p> Time: Season of the Chosen, Week 3, Wednesday. One week after Annie’s resurrection.
			Location: Tower, Last City, Earth.</p>
			<p> Annie looked upon the market of the tower in confusion. So many lights, sounds, and people made Annie feel small and lost. She took a deep breath and walked through the crowd, they did not seem to care that Annie was there, which made her feel the safest that she has ever felt since her rebirth. But it would not last long. Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted an old man in golden eagle armor starting down Annie. When Annie fully looked at him, he turned away quickly and went back to messing with some small cube contraption at his fingertips. Annie felt a tingle down her spine but then she just brushed it off as just a random Guardian and went on with her business. After a little more walking she finally saw who she was looking for, Ikora Rey. Ikora was in mostly in purple armor and talking to a man in bright blue and white armor by her side. She stopped and turned to Annie, saying “Hello guardian, welcome to the tower.” “Ummm... thanks? Though this isn’t my first time here” Annie said. “You must be Ikora then?” “Yes, I am Ikora. Warlock Vanguard. Do you know why I called you here?” Ikora said in a mellow voice. “No, is it because of my past?” Annie asked. “No, this is not about your past. Though it is an interesting topic, that is not why we are here. I brought you here because I have heard that you don’t know how to use the powers that you have. Do you know anything about a Guardians ability?” Ikora asked. “No” Annie said “Well… I guess the only thing I know is that someone had a gun that was on fire, but I do not know if that is like a trick or what” “Hmm. You must have seen someone cast a golden gun, and yes, it is a special ability Hunters can use” Ikora said. “Hunters? What are those? Am I a hunter?” Annie asked. “Well, I don’t know, have you been told what you are by your ghost?” Ikora asked back. “Oh Jade? Well… She’s… damaged and I do not have the glimmer, is that what you call it? To repair her so for now she can only do a couple of things like appear, talk, get transmissions and messages like the one you sent me, and revive me.” “Oh my, what happened to Jade to make her damaged?” Ikora questioned. “Well, I was” Annie started saying before being interrupted by an old, stern voice behind her saying “She was attacked by a hive wizard and her army on the moon. I am unsure of the wizard’s name but trust me she will be dealt with soon” Now closer to Annie she saw that it was the old man that was looking at her earlier. He has a grayed-out beard and wrinkles over his face showing his age. The man in the blue standing next to Ikora spoke to the old man with a sarcastic tone, saying “Welcome to the conversation Osiris, any other wisdom you share?” “For now, no. But ask me again later in private and I can tell you some stuff…” Osiris gazed over at Annie in loud silence. “Well, since you ghost is damaged we cannot tell if you are a Titan, a Warlock, or a Hunter until you either repair your ghost or find your abilities. So, to help you channel your strength and find your power, I am tasking Tobias here to help you find it. You think you can do it Tobias?” She says turning to the guardian in blue next to her. He said “Yeah I’ll do it” Tobias said “You free this weekend? Uh. What is your name mate?” He said to Annie “My name is Annie, and yes I should be free. Where can I meet you?” “Oh, I’ll contact you when the times comes.” Tobias said “Until then, don’t try to get too messed up. See ya later.” “Bye.” Tobias got up from his sitting position and walked away talking to his ghost. “You heard him, this weekend you should find hopefully find yourself Annie. Until we meet again.” Ikora said. Annie walked away with no where to go. She walked up to a food stand that was nearby and looked at all of the unique ramen options that she does not have the money to buy. Suddenly she hears a voice with a western accent coming from a shaded corner saying “Well look at you sister, looks like you don’t have any glimmer to your name, can’t even buy ramen? Heh, I can change that.” “Who are you” Annie asked the mysterious man, he stepped out of the darkness showing his blue cloak, big brown furry shoulder pads, and his scruffy face saying “Name’s Drifter. I run this thing called Gambit, and let me tell you sister, I could get you rich if you win.” Annie walked closer to Drifter saying, “First, I am not you sister, I mean look at me, no way we could be related. Second, I do not think I am fit for your ‘Gambit’ I only own one gun and do not know how to use abilities.” “Oh, you need help. I know somebody that can help you. Got a ship that can take you to Europa?” “No. Like you observed I have basically nothing.” “Look,” Drifter says, “I do not do this often. But I see something in you. Here,” Drifter holds his hand out and materializes a bright blue cube, “Here is 5,000 glimmer. Common currency here, there is someone in the hanger named Amanda, find her and get yourself a ship. And go to these coordinates on Europa and go north. There will be something for you there.” Drifter says chuckling a little before handing her the cube and talking once more “And oh, get something more to wear, just a sports bra and cargo shorts won’t cut it in Europa, It’s cold as hell.” He then leaves down a staircase to the side. After drifter is out of sight, Jade appears in front of Annie saying, “Wow, he-e-e actually gave us glimmer” Jade said, “Well let’s go talk to A-A-Amanda and get you something better to wear, although I do like the shorts.” “Thanks Jade.” </p>
			<p>Time: Season of the Chosen, Week 3, Friday.
			Location: Beyond, Europa.</p>
				<p> Annie transmats into a cold Europa. Annie’s new black trench coat helps defend her from the cold and her new boots help her trek through the desolate, snowy landscape of Europa. In the distance ahead of her is a small camp that drifter marked for Annie to find. Annie starts walking through the high snow levels to it. It is deathly silent there and Annie’s ears catch on to her own feet moving through the snow, a crunch is heard for each foot landing. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, left foot again? Annie turns around hearing a foot hit the snow that was not hers, though she sees no one behind her, but an extra boot print in the snow that does not belong to her. She continues walking again listening closely to the snow. Left, right, left, right, right. When she heard the extra footprint she quickly turned around and threw a punch back, it connected with an invisible force and it got revealed as it crashed into the snow, it was a person, a Guardian. The guardian had a white vest, a purple hoodie with purple and white armor on top of it all. Annie got close to the guardian and grabbed the guardian by top of their vest and pulled them close with one fist ready to punch in case they try anything. Annie directed at the guardian “Who are you?! Why are you following me? Looking to kill me over and over like others have?!” The guardian’s face was finally in view of Annie, it was a woman with pink hair, soft blue eyes, and pink lipstick that got partially messed up in part by Annie’s punch and the snow. “I… uhm… hi.” She said, starting to turn red. “I will not say this again, Who. Are. You.” Annie demanded pulling her fist back to prepare for a punch, “Hey, hey, take it easy. I uh, my name is Viserra, but please call me Vi.” Vi said nervously, “I um, saw you a while ago, when you came to the tower, and I was… interested with you.” Annie slowly lowers her fist and says “Interested? Interested in what?” “Well. Huh… you.” Vi said getting even more red, “Me? Why?” “Well, I know what you have done and-” “Not again” Annie interrupted, “Please, if I did anything to you in my past life, there is no need to take it off on me now.” “Oh, don’t worry, I am not going to hurt you” Vi said “I uh, saw you in your past life and you saved my life, well… saved me by killing the dreg that knocked me down and then killing me because you did not know me and definitely did not trust me. Then last week in the tower when you arrived I recognized you even though you were really beat up and I wanted to say thanks cause if you did not kill that dreg my ghost and I would surely be a goner.” Annie looks Vi up and down and remembers that she was sitting next to Saint-14 and his pigeons when Crow was giving Annie a tour of the tower. “Oh, yeah. I have seen you before.” “C-, can you let me go? Please?” Vi said, still lifted in the air by Annie, “Oh, sorry. But please do not hurt me okay?” “Of course.” Annie let go of Vi and she fell down to her knees, Vi looked up to Annie towering over her and she turned invisible again in a flash of purple void light. “Hey! Where? What?” Annie tried grabbing where Vi was, but she was gone. Annie took a deep breath and began walking to the camp again. When she arrived, there was a campfire that was extinguished and a radio that replayed messages from a slow, bug like voice talking about something called “House Judgement”. She walked past and into the tent, the door opened into a white and gold room, there was a white circular table in the center of the room. On that table was a pair of gloves and a green coin. Annie picked up the gloves, they were long and had wires that lead from the edge of the glove and to the top of each finger. It seemed like a part of the glove has seen fire as there are darkened spots that resemble burn marks. Annie brought her face close to the gauntlets and smelled it. It had a dark, crisp smell of ash and fire that did not please Annie. Jade appeared and said “I just got a mes-ss-ssage from Drifter-r-r. It says ‘Ah so you finally made it, huh? Take what’s on the table, both the gauntlets and the coin are for you. And uh, don’t forget you owe me for the glimmer I gave you okay? Put the gauntlets on once you find yourself. Come see me in the tower if you want to settle your debt, ~Drifter’ Wait, he-he-he didn’t say that we had to pay that back… oh my.” “Well,” Annie said, “I guess we own these now. Thanks, I guess Drifter.” </p>
			<p> Time: Season of the Chosen, Week 3, Saturday.
			Location: Well of Flame, Nessus. </p>
				<p> The spot of where Tobias wanted to meet Annie was deep in the planet of Nessus, in a strange structure that Tobias called the “Well of Flame”. Annie transmated in front of a large stone pillar, she looked up at the giant structure and noticed Tobias sitting at a triangle entrance that goes into the pillar. Tobias sees Annie down below and waved her up to him. Annie traversed up several uneven platforms to where Tobais was sitting, watching over the horizon. “Ever been to Nessus before? Beautiful but dangerous place. Overrun by vex who claim it as their own and cabal that mine for its resources and try to control it for its tactical position in the solar system between what was Jupiter and Neptune. And of course, Fallen who try and salvage whatever they can find.” Tobais said, he stands up and guides Annie through the triangle entrance in the pillar and down a dimly lit staircase and to a large, light blue circular portal. Annie stopped walking and looked at the portal in skepticism. Tobais after realizing that Annie had stopped walking, turned around and asked “You scared? Trust me, there is nothing to fear. Here, watch.” Tobais spread his arms out and walked backwards into the portal. The portal made a wobbly sound, and he disappeared as he got teleported somewhere. Annie took the gun out of the holster on her right leg and took a deep breath in and walked though the portal. The same wobbly sound came from the portal as Annie was taken through to a dark, rocky tunnel. “See, nothing to fear. I come here all the time to meditate and take time away from it all, because I know it can be stress full at times. Have you ever felt stressed Annie?” Tobias said, “Well, every day I feel stress,” Annie said, “Every day I look around and are met with new challenges and troubles that I just do not know how to solve at times. And because of my past people only know me for that and the crimes I have done in my past life, this past that I barely remember because of my loss of memory.” Tobais leads Annie into a large circular room with white liquid surrounding a central circular only accessible by tall rectangular platforms and one bridge that Tobais and Annie crossed. “Sit, please.” Tobias says as he sits down on one side of a ring in the center of the room and Annie sits on the other side. “I am going to try and help you find your powers through meditation. Here, open your hands” Tobias reaches over as Annie opens her hands. He places a feather in her left hand, “Take your weapon out and place it in your right hand.” Annie did as he told, holding the grey pistol that Crow bought for her. “The feather represents your mind: calm, soft, and floating. Your weapon represents your strength: strong, loud, and forceful. Take deep breaths in and deep breaths out. Now, tell me about a time where something went wrong. It can be anything.” Annie looks down at the scars that are present on her chest and legs and thinks for a moment before developing an answer, “Last week, I uh, was resurrected on the moon, and during that time I was attacked by the hive, they took Jade, my ghost, and they killed me, over, and over, and over again. I felt so useless. I tried to cry for help, but nobody was around to save me. Every time they forcefully revived me they would just rip me apart from limb to limb. Again, and again.” She gripped the gun in her left hand tightly, “If I had a weapon, if I had my powers, I could have done something. But I didn’t. I am worthless. This is just who I am.” “Oh Annie,” Tobias said, “What happened there does not define you, it refines you. You are strong, I know you are. You may not see it, but I do. You are here today because you persevered, you survived. You want to know how I know?” “How?” Annie asked, Tobias lifted his arm and pointed at Annie, “Because you are sitting right in front of me.” There was a silence that filled the air for a moment where the only thing you could hear was both of them breathing. Far away from where they came there was a noise, a familiar noise of the portal transporting someone. “What was that?” Annie asked. Then several circles of lights started formulating in the far sides of the circular room. “Oh no. No, no, no, no, no, not now of all times.” Tobias said, “What’s going on?” Annie asked. “No time to explain, get up and prepare to fight, if there is ever a time to find out your powers now is the time!” Tobais yelled. Several vex troops came out of the light and into the pool of vex milk that surrounded them, they took a moment to look around the room and identified Tobias and Annie. Then they started shooting at them with their weapons of arc energy. Annie whipped her gun and pointed it at some of the vex goblins that appeared but one of their shots hit her gun and burnt a hole right through it, Annie tries to shoot it, but it does not fire. “Shit! Not again! This can’t be happening!” The vex goblins keep on firing upon both of them, Tobias fought back with his acrobatic moves and lightning fists, but it isn’t enough, they just keep on coming. Annie took cover behind a pillar, her head started throbbing with a headache growing stronger and stronger. A vex goblin turned the corner facing a hiding Annie and starts charging to fire its weapon. Annie reaches out to try and block the bullet with her hand, she closes her eyes and let’s out a scream of anger and fear. Annie was expecting a swift death from the goblin but, nothing came. She opened her eyes and saw that the goblin has been destroyed in front of her, its body blown to pieces with void power. She looks over at her hand and it has a purple shine to it and void particles flowing around her body. She feels her body be revitalized, like she is an entirely new person, her bones tingle with the power that she is experiencing. Tobais punches a flying wyvern into the ground with so much force that it basically exploded into a million pieces. He turns to look at Annie and sees her and the void energy all around her, “YES!” he yells, “You have found it! Welcome to the way of the Voidwalker, Warlock!” “Heh, finally, the hunter becomes the hunted” Annie whispers to herself now feeling this surge of confidence and strength. She sees more goblins and wyverns coming towards her, she runs ahead dodging the energy shots they throw her way. She grabs the headpiece of the front most goblin and throws it into the ground, exploding in void light when it crashed. She jumps up and accidentally blinks into the air almost face planting back onto the ground before catching herself and throwing a punch at the wyvern with her right hand and uppercutting a goblin with her left, both exploding after a short time. The final goblin tries to turn around and run but Annie caught him and lifted them up, let out a loud yell, and then ripped them apart, the vex milk fueling the goblin covering Annie, causing minor burns to her but it gets melted off fast due to all the void light flowing through her. Ahead of her emerging from the vex milk is a large minotaur with a bright purple shield covering its body. They both lock eyes and Annie prepares to jump forward to kill the minotaur, but the minotaur disappeared and teleported somewhere. Annie heard a noise behind her and as she turns her head to look, she gets launched forward by the minotaur and hits the ground hard. She looks up to the minotaur as it is about to stomp on her and… In a flash of more void light the leg of the minotaur gets cut off and a bright pink knife stabs through the shield and the milky heart of the minotaur. The knife pulls out as the minotaur falls over revealing Vi, the guardian from Europa, standing there with two bright void knives. “You,” Annie tries to say something before getting interrupted by Vi, “Don’t talk, just fight.” Vi reaches out and helps Annie back to her feet. Vi blinks backward and starts fighting vex troops one by one with her spectral blades, Annie gets her bearings and starts flowing with energy again and starts figuring out her abilities one by one though different emotions and feelings, she can drop a rift that heals those around her, she can throw raw energy like a baseball to her enemies, and if she channels her anger she can throw a mini vortex that drains energy from those trapped, Tobias channeled his arc energy and summoned an arc staff that flows with so much electricity that anything that it touches gets killed immediately. Back, to back, to back. Tobias, Annie, and Vi. Fighting together to defend themselves, After a minute of intense fighting there were nothing more but the three guardians standing there and several mechanical corpses of the vex that tried to kill them. Annie after there were no more combatants, calmed down and the void energy stopped flowing through her body. Annie walked over to Vi and said, “Thank you for saving me, I do not know what would have happened if you weren’t here” Vi turned to Annie, looked her in the eyes, and said “Any day.” She winked at Annie and went disappeared from sight. Tobias walked up to Annie and asked, “So warlock Annie, how do you feel?” “I feel… alive” Annie responded. “Great” Tobias said, “Well. I think we are done here; we should probably leave before more arrive eh? See you around.” Tobais went back to the portal that led them there and went through it. After he was gone Jade appeared and said “Wow! I-I-I can’t believe we did that! Well, I guess you are a warlock then!” Jade made a small buzzing noise that indicated that she got a message. “Is that Ikora? Word sure does travel quickly” Annie said. “No,” Jade responded, “It’s from Vi!” “Vi? But why? What was her message?” Annie asked. “It’s just an address, in the Last City! And it also says one word, Home.” </p>
